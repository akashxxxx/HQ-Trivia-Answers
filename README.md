# HQ Trivia Answers
This is a project that I have created to answer HQ Trivia questions. There are two different methods of trying to find the answer. The only requirement other than the application itself is that you will need a way to stream your phone screen to your computer. The software then captures a picture of your screen and parses the data into the question and the three answers.
